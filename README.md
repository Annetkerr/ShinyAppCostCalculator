Assignment 1

This application calculates the estimated costs of two methods of implementing a specific software
hosting solution. A company is willing to subsidize the cost to implement said solution for each of its branch offices. The solution can be implemented either as a standalone for each office, or in a shared site model. This application presents an interactive look at the overall cost to the main office for a variety scenarios of implementing all standalone, all shared, or a combination. The app also alows the user to set certain assumptions about the overhead costs of each option.

The inputs for the standalone otpion are:
Number of offices using the standalone solution
Assumed overhead cost to main office to maintain standardization across the different platforms

The inputs for the shared site option are:
Nubmer of office using the shared site
Assumed overhead cost to main office to maintain standardization in a shared site model
Assumed percentage of shared systems administration cost main office will subsidize
